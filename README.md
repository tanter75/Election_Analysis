## Election_Audit Summary:
The election_audit script would be useful to tabulate election results for not only county votes, but for any election result with some modifications.
This script allows for a summary of total votes, summarized by voting area and candidate.  By modifying the headers, such as subsituting state for county, this script can be used to effectively tabulate the results for municipal, state and federal elections.
